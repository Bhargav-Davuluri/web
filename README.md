# WEB ICP 7

In this ICP we implemented update and delete functionality for Library Management System

# Basic Requirements of this ICP

1. First install MongoDB on my local system and then modified the source code to implement the update and delete functionality of the book from the MongoDB database.

2. We used the following commands to bring up the application.
    
    npm install
    
    npm run start
